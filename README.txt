For running the implementation, just run the "project.m" file.

5 images will appear:

1. The original "Lena" 256x256 picture (in black-and_white)
2. The picture with AWGN added
3. The picture denoised through the paper algorithm implementation
4. The picture denoised through the Visushrink hard-threshold implementation
5. The picture denoised through the Visushrink soft-threshold implementation

The corresponding SNR of noisy and all three denoised pictures will also be printed in the Command Window.

The code for the Visushrink algorithm (used for comparison) was implemented by M. Kiran Kumar, and downloaded through the 
Mathworks website (www.mathworks.com).

The Lipschitz Exponents were calculated through equation (9) of the paper entitled "Measurement of Lipschitz Exponent (LE)
using Wavelet Transform Modulus Maxima (WTMM)", by Venkatakrishnan et al. (IJSER - June/2012).
